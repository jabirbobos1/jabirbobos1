         ABOUT THIS WEBSITE
      </p>
      <p class="about-story">
        This website was created by Jabir Sanusi Rikiji his Web Technology And Appliaion project. He learned HTML and CSS in just 
        one weekend from <a class="about-youtube-link" href="https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc?si=wlwwLfLEf3fP2dUc">this video</a> he managed to use that knowledge
        to create this website. it only took him 3 days.
      </p>
      <p class="about-content">
        This website contains grids, images, hyperlinks, boxes, bars and one dropdown.
        i chose not to use dropdowns because i dont really think they'll suit 
        the website so i just did one to demonstrate that i can. pagination too.
